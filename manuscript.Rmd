abstract:
  Shallow coral reefs are extensively studied, and although scleractinian corals have been recorded to 165 m, little is known about other mesophotic coral reef ecosystem (MCE) inhabitants. Brachyuran crabs fill many ecological and trophic niches on reefs, making them ideal candidates for evaluating species composition among depths. Here we ask if MCEs host the same communities as the shallower reefs spread across the entire 2400 km Hawaiian Archipelago. We deployed Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) for two years among shallow sites (12 m) across the latitudinal gradient of the Hawaiian Archipelago to compare directly with a depth gradient (12, 30, 60, and 90 m) south of OÊ»ahu island. A total of 2284 individual crabs representing 90 morphospecies (19 families) were found. Assemblage composition was not statistically significantly different among shallow sites spread across the archipelago but was significantly different and highly stratified across the depth gradient.  We show that 90 m of depth is a more potent determinant of brachyuran community composition than the latitudinal, geographic (high vs low islands), or anthropogenic impact (human population size) gradient across the archipelago. Deeper reefs host significantly different brachyuran communities than shallow ones in Hawai&#x02BB;i, and only 3 of 90 morphospecies (~3%) occurring across the entire depth range (mesophotic to shallow) were sampled. Further research on the cryptic reef-dwelling fauna is needed for identifying areas of unique biodiversity, as well as boundaries between depth-stratified reef ecosystems.

# Introduction {-}
Natural communities are structured by a suite of biotic and abiotic factors including geography, habitat complexity, environment, productivity, and species interactions (among many others) [@begonEcologyIndividualsEcosystems2021] and such complexity makes direct comparisons over large geographic scales challenging. Marine communities in particular experience unique influences and present research challenges not found in terrestrial habitats [@steeleComparisonTerrestrialMarine1985; @kinlanPropaguleDispersalMarine2003; @raffaelliMarineTerrestrialEcologists2005; @grosbergBiodiversityWaterLand2012; @knappDriversBiodiversityChange2017]. Much of our understanding of biotic zonation and community structure in the ocean comes from classic studies in the intertidal (some of the best-studied marine habitats) [e.g., @connellInfluenceInterspecificCompetition1961; @connellEffectsCompetitionPredation1961; @paineIntertidalCommunityStructure1974]. Such studies point to a combination of physical and biological factors, including physiological tolerance [@dennyPhysicalProcessesThat2001; @someroThermalPhysiologyVertical2002] and species interactions [@brunoHabitatModificationFacilitation2001; @mengeRockyIntertidalCommunities2001], that contribute to the structure of intertidal communities. Although there are exceptions [e.g., @woottonIndirectEffectsPrey1992; @bertnessTestingRelativeContribution1999], a generalization has emerged for the intertidal that lower limits of species distributions are set by ecological interactions whereas upper limits are determined by abiotic factors.

Despite conclusions based on intertidal studies, similar generalizations have not emerged to describe coral reef communities [@moraEcologyFishesCoral2015; @sheppardBiologyCoralReefs2017], with existing hypotheses ranging from the neutral theory of biodiversity [@hubbellUnifiedNeutralTheory2011] and lottery recruitment [@saleStockRecruitRelationshipsRegional1982] to competitive networks [@bussCompetitiveNetworksNontransitive1979] and fine-scale resource partitioning driven by predators and herbivores [@abramsRecruitmentLotteriesCoexistence1984; @hixonPredationPreyRefuges1993]. Studies that have investigated these topics on coral reefs have traditionally focused on conspicuous taxa such as fishes and corals [@cite], yet these groups constitute a minority of total reef biodiversity [@cite]. The majority of coral reef biodiversity is cryptic, inhabiting interstitial spaces, and little is known about factors contributing to     Zooxanthellate corals are the ecosystem engineers of reef habitats but are restricted to specific areas characterized by a relatively narrow range of chemical and physical parameters<!-- (i.e., tropical and subtropical warm waters, oligotrophic conditions, 32-40 PSU salinity, and sufficient incident light, which decreases rapidly below ~30 m depth)-->. Shallow coral reef ecosystems cover less than 0.2% of the seafloor and in such a small area they hold the 32-38% of all marine species [@fisherSpeciesRichnessCoral2015]. Yet the <!--drivers of high biodiversity and the -->mechanisms by which communities are structured on coral reefs remain a subject of debate [@carrBiodiversityPopulationRegulation2002; @connollyIndoPacificBiodiversityCoral2003; @almanyDoesIncreasedHabitat2004; @bellwoodEnvironmentalGeometricConstraints2005, 2006; @dornelasCoralReefDiversity2006; @grahamImportanceStructuralComplexity2013; @komyakovaRelativeImportanceCoral2013]. *Add some text about community structuring across space, rather than just at smaller scales*. 

A<!--nother--> likely important but under-investigated aspect of coral reef community structure is depth. Most studies to date have focused on the upper ~30 m of the water column, yet coral reefs and associated communities are known to extend beyond 150 m [@pyleExploringDeepCoral1996; @pyleMesophoticCoralEcosystems2019], with scleractinian corals reported to 170 m [@rouzeSymbioticAssociationsDeepest2021]. As much as two thirds of coral reef ecosystems lie in this under-explored zone [@hindersteinThemeSectionMesophotic2010]. These habitats, known as mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs), are typically defined as those extending from ~30--150 m depth [@hindersteinThemeSectionMesophotic2010; @kahngCommunityEcologyMesophotic2010]. <!--and were believed to experience dampened disturbances in comparison to shallow reefs and could therefore act as deep water refugia for shallow reef species threatened by anthropogenic impacts --> They have been hypothesized as possible refugia from disturbances on shallow reefs [@bongaertsAssessingDeepReef2010; @smithDepthRefugiumCatastrophic2014; @holsteinFertileFathomsDeep2015; @muirSpeciesIdentityDepth2017], although a number of studies have found evidence that deep reefs are unique and uniquely threatened, challenging this notion [@hobanPlumbingDepthsEnvironmental2023a; @hurleyAssessmentShallowMesophotic2016; @kaneHighLevelsMesophotic2014; @pinheiroDeepReefFishes2019; @rochaMesophoticCoralEcosystems2018]. <!--However, recent literature describing species compositions along depth gradients reveal a more complex picture among taxa and locations because some groups may use mesophotic reefs as a refuge in some places, while others show community turnover with depth such that MCE habitats are ecologically distinct from adjacent shallow water coral reefs [@hurleyAssessmentShallowMesophotic2016; @smithCaribbeanMesophoticCoral2016; @semmlerAreMesophoticCoral2017; @bongaertsDeepReefsAre2017; @rochaMesophoticCoralEcosystems2018]. Further, there are a range of connections depending on the taxa â large, mobile organisms like fish tend to have more shared species across depth than sedentary organisms such as corals and algae, but even among the fishes the community structure of MCEs is often distinct [@kaneHighLevelsMesophotic2014; @pyleComprehensiveInvestigationMesophotic2016 ; @asherMesophoticDepthGradients2017; @fukunagaChangesMesophoticReef2017; @colemanShiftingReefFish2018; @pinheiroDeepReefFishes2019]. Although the majority of coral reef biodiversity consists of the algal and invertebrate cryptobenthic organisms living on and within the reef structure [@fautinOverviewMarineBiodiversity2010; @knowltonCoralReefBiodiversity2010; @fisherSpeciesRichnessCoral2015], the studies listed above focus almost exclusively on the corals and fishes which are more easily surveyed.-->

Studies examining community structure along depth or latitudinal gradients have been criticized for confounding multiple potentially covarying aspects of the environment (such as habitat area or complexity) across the measured gradients [e.g., @bellwoodRegionalScaleAssemblyRules2001; @grahamEffectsMarineReserve2003; @connollyCommunityStructureCorals2005; @ewersConfoundingFactorsDetection2006; @fletcherRoleHabitatArea2007a]. Here, we employed autonomous reef monitoring structures (ARMS) [@zimmermanArtificialReefMatrix2004; @brainardAutonomousReefMonitoring2009], collection devices designed to mimic reef structural complexity and enable sampling of cryptic fauna in a standardized way. Using ARMS, we sampled brachyuran crab communities across the Hawaiian Archipelago to test the effects of environmental and anthropogenic drivers on the structure of cryptic reef communities. The Hawaiian Archipelago comprises high volcanic islands and atolls stretching across ~2,500 km in the North Pacific Ocean, and is typically regarded as two regions: the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) are the eight inhabited high islands, and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) are the uninhabited atolls and banks northwest of Kaua&#x02BB;i. The islands are subject to anthropogenic and physical gradients across their span [@selkoeMapHumanImpacts2009], which we hypothesize to affect the variation in structure of sampled communities. We compared crab communities among islands and regions (MHI vs. NWHI) and examined the effects of a suite of possible drivers on community variation. Given the possibility for considerable separation between deep and shallow reefs [e.g., @hobanPlumbingDepthsEnvironmental2023a; @hurleyAssessmentShallowMesophotic2016; @rochaMesophoticCoralEcosystems2018], we also compared the relative effects of depth (shallow vs. mesophotic) and island region.   Given the number and magnitude of differences between these regions, we hypothesized that species diversity would be different between regions (MHI vs NWHI). We therefore looked at community composition along the latitudinal gradient and investigated community composition in response to physical gradients (depth, temperature), biological gradients (coral cover, chlorophyll concentration), geological gradients (island slope, distances between neighboring islands), and anthropogenic gradients (human population count, human impacts). We hypothesized that the communities found across the latitudinal gradient encompassing all of these environmental variables would show fewer differences between individual islands or atolls, but would be greatest between the two regions, MHI and NWHI.  Finally, to investigate whether a latitudinal gradient or depth gradient would be a stronger force in driving community composition, we compared the reef crab assemblage from across the shallow reefs in the Hawaiian Archipelago to reef crab assemblages across a mesophotic depth gradient. 

The Hawaiian Archipelago is a volcanic island arc made up of high islands and atolls spanning ~9 degrees of latitude and ~2,500 km. It is typically regarded as two regions: the inhabited main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), which include the eight islands from Hawai&#x02BB;i Island to Kauai&#x02BB;i, and the largely uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), which constitute the 10 low islands and atolls to the northwest of Kaua&#x02BB;i. We compared shallow reef crab communities across the 2500 km archipelago and  we compared reef crab assemblages from the shallow reefs to the reef crab assemblages across a mesophotic depth gradient off of Kewalo, OÊ»ahu. By controlling for habitat area and complexity and by incorporating sites across various environmental and human impact gradients, we sought to better understand whether latitude, the environment, or depth is more influential in structuring reef crab communities.


# Materials and Methods {-}

## Sample Collection {-}

Brachyuran crab assemblages were sampled from benthic coral reef habitat in the Hawaiian Archipelago using Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS). ARMS are standardized collection devices designed to mimic coral reef structural complexity to attract settlement of reef cryptofauna [@zimmermanArtificialReefMatrix2004; @brainardAutonomousReefMonitoring2009]. They are constructed from 10 gray type 1 PVC plates (23 cm $\times$ 23 cm) stacked in an alternating series of open and semi-enclosed layers ([@fig:fig_arms]). The stack is fastened to a larger base plate (35 cm $\times$ 45 cm) which can be attached to the benthos upon deployment [@brainardAutonomousReefMonitoring2009; @hurleyAssessmentShallowMesophotic2016; @knowltonCoralReefBiodiversity2010; @zimmermanArtificialReefMatrix2004].

A total of 89 ARMS units were deployed over the course of six years (2010--2016). Units were deployed by NOAA scuba divers during Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) research cruises in shallow coral reef habitat (12â16 m depth) in both the Main (MHI) and Northwest Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) ([@fig:fig_map; @tbl:arms_table]). <!--The sites in the MHI were at Hawai&#x02BB;i Island, Maui, O&#x02BB;ahu, and Kaua&#x02BB;i. The sites in the NWHI were at Lalo (French Frigate Shoals), Kapou (Lisianski), Manawai (Pearl & Hermes), and HÅlanikÅ« (Kure Atoll) ([@fig:fig_map]). -->To explore the effects of depth, we also present data from an earlier study by Hurley et al. [-@hurleyAssessmentShallowMesophotic2016], which included a total of 27 units deployed off O&#x02BB;ahu from 2009â2012 in 12â90 m depth; nine units were deployed at 12 m, and six each at 30 m, 60 m, and 90 m ([@tbl:arms_table]). Shallow units were deployed according to standard NOAA methodology, whereas units $\geq$ 30 m were deployed and recovered using technical mixed gas closed-circuit rebreather diving [see @hurleyAssessmentShallowMesophotic2016].

ARMS units were retrieved by encapsulating them in-situ in a mesh-lined crate (100 Î¼m pore size) to prevent escape of motile organisms. Once returned to the surface, they were placed in containers of aerated, filtered seawater, crates were removed, and units were systematically disassembled plate-by-plate. Seawater surrounding disassembled units was sieved through 2 mm, 500 Î¼m, and 100 Î¼m mesh-size geologic sieves [see @lerayDNABarcodingMetabarcoding2015 for processing details], and retained macroorganisms were preserved in 95% ethanol. All adult brachyuran crabs ($\geq$ 5 mm) were photographed, identified to morphospecies, and preserved in 95% ethanol. Individual preserved specimens were accessioned into the invertebrate zoology collections at the Florida Museum of Natural History (catalog numbers xxxâxxx). 

## Data analysis {-}

Unless otherwise specified, all analyses were performed using `R` version 4.1.2 [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2021]. Community data were loaded and encapsulated into data objects using the R package `phyloseq` [@mcmurdiePhyloseqPackageReproducible2013] and multivariate community analyses were performed using the package `vegan` [@oksanenVeganCommunityEcology2022] on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities of Hellinger-transformed species abundance matrices [@legendreEcologicallyMeaningfulTransformations2001; @raoReviewCanonicalCoordinates1995]. 

To examine patterns of crab diversity across the islands, we used `estimate_richness` to calculate species richness and Simpson diversity (Simpson = $1-\sum_{i=1}^{R}p_i^2$, where R is the total number of species, and $\mathrm{p}_i$ is the proportional abundance of each species). We used nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ranked sum tests to compare diversity between shallow and mesophotic samples and between island groups (MHI vs. NWHI). Island group comparisons were performed both with and without mesophotic samples. <!--To explore environmental influences on alpha diversity, we used a linear mixed-effect model with Simpson or richness as response variables, the environmental variables listed below as fixed effects, and island nested within island group (MHI vs NWHI) as random effects. Models were generated using the `lmer` function from the `lme4` package [@batesFittingLinearMixedEffects2015]. -->

We used distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA; a form of multivariate multiple regression) with `dbrda` to examine the relative contribution of environmental variables to crab community variation across the islands. We first used a stepwise forward selection procedure (`ordiR2step`) to find the variables that best explained community dissimilarity. Then, we sequentially removed variables with the largest variance inflation factors (VIF; calculated using `vif.cca`) until all values were <3, indicating variables were sufficiently uncorrelated. Model significance was assessed using permutation tests with `r num(PERM,1)` permutations (function `anova`). Continuous variables were scaled to unit variance. We assessed variation among groups using `betadisper` and `adonis2`. These functions implement analysis of multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions (PERMDISP) and multivariate permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) respectively. PERMDISP is used to assess variability within groups and PERMANOVA is used to assess differences among groups. Significance was assessed with permutation tests in both cases. Variation among sampling groups (shallow MHI, shallow NWHI, O&#x02BB;ahu 30 m, 60 m, 90 m) was further examined and visualized using canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) based on discriminant analysis [@andersonCanonicalAnalysisPrincipal2003] as implemented in the `CAPdiscrim` function in `BiodiversityR` [@kindtTreeDiversityAnalysis2005]. 

## Environmental variables {-}

Potential environmental drivers of shallow crab community structure were assembled from published literature [@selkoeDNACoralReef2016], NOAA's National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP), and the Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System (PacIOOS) ([@tbl:env_table]). Due to logistical limitations, environmental factors are only available for shallow samples.

## Diversity summary {-}

### All ARMS {-}

The `r nsamples(cc$crabs_untransformed)` ARMS units deployed across the Hawaiian Islands (in `r format_range(cc$crab_data$depth)` m depth) yielded a total of `r num(sum(sample_sums(cc$crabs_untransformed)),1)` adult crabs. Units contained `r num(all_summary$abundance_mean,0.1)` $\pm$ `r num(all_summary$abundance_sd,0.1)` (mean $\pm$ SD) individuals, and abundance ranged from `r format_range(all_summary$abundance_range)`. Crabs were identified to `r sum(unlist(all_summary$types_breakdown))` distinct types (including `r all_summary$types_breakdown$species` species and `r all_summary$types_breakdown$morphospecies` morphospecies) in `r all_summary$taxonomy_breakdown$genera` genera and `r all_summary$taxonomy_breakdown$families` families, which accounted for ~36% of the known crab diversity reported from Hawaiian waters [@castroCatalogAnomuranBrachyuran2011]. The four most abundant species were: `r with(all_summary,top_list(top,top_n,top_units,fig="fig_crabs"))`. `r str_to_sentence(english(all_summary$singleton_count))` species occurred in a single unit across all sites (singletons), accounting for ~`r num(all_summary$singleton_count/ntaxa(cc$crabs_untransformed)*100,1)`% of total recovered crab species.

### Mesophotic ARMS {-}

The `r nsamples(cc$crabs_deep)` units deployed at mesophotic depths $\geq$ 30 m on O&#x02BB;ahu yielded fewer species and individuals compared to the complete dataset, with `r num(sum(sample_sums(cc$crabs_deep)),1)` crabs overall, `r sum(unlist(deep_summary$types_breakdown))` distinct types (`r deep_summary$types_breakdown$species` species and `r deep_summary$types_breakdown$morphospecies` morphospecies), `r num(deep_summary$abundance_mean,0.1)` $\pm$ `r num(deep_summary$abundance_sd,0.1)` individuals per unit, and abundance ranging from `r format_range(deep_summary$abundance_range)`. The four most abundant species in the deep ARMS did not overlap with those from the complete dataset: `r with(deep_summary,top_list(top,top_n,top_units))`. There were `r deep_summary$singleton_count` singletons, which proportionally accounted for ~`r num(deep_summary$singleton_count/ntaxa(cc$crabs_deep)*100,1)`% of species found on deep ARMS. 

## Alpha diversity {-}

### Summary {-}

Overall mean species richness for the complete dataset was `r num(all_alpha$richness,0.1)` $\pm$ `r num(all_alpha$richness_sd,0.1)` species per unit (Simpson diversity: `r num(all_alpha$simpson,0.01)` $\pm$ `r num(all_alpha$simpson_sd,0.01)`). Overall mean species richness for shallow ARMS \< 30 m was `r num(shallow_alpha$richness,0.1)` $\pm$ `r num(shallow_alpha$richness_sd,0.1)` species per unit (Simpson diversity: `r num(shallow_alpha$simpson,0.01)` $\pm$ `r num(shallow_alpha$simpson_sd,0.01)`). Overall mean species richness for mesophotic ARMS $\geq$ 30 m was `r num(deep_alpha$richness,0.1)` $\pm$ `r num(deep_alpha$richness_sd,0.1)` species per unit (Simpson diversity: `r num(deep_alpha$simpson,0.01)` $\pm$ `r num(deep_alpha$simpson_sd,0.01)`). 

### Comparisons {-}

For the complete dataset, there was no significant difference in observed species richness between the MHI and NWHI ([@fig:fig_alpha[]{}A]; `r k_test(all_alpha$k_r_island)`), but Simpson diversity was significantly different ([@fig:fig_alpha[]{}C]; `r k_test(all_alpha$k_s_island,plain=TRUE)`). Richness was not significantly different between shallow and deep samples ([@fig:fig_alpha[]{}B]; `r k_test(all_alpha$k_r_depth,plain=TRUE)`) but Simpson diversity was ([@fig:fig_alpha[]{}D]; `r k_test(all_alpha$k_s_depth,plain=TRUE)`). When only shallow arms \< 30 m were considered, neither comparison was significant (richness: `r k_test(shallow_alpha$k_r_island,plain=TRUE)`, [@fig:fig_alpha2[]{}A]; Simpson: `r k_test(shallow_alpha$k_s_island,plain=TRUE)`, [@fig:fig_alpha2[]{}B]).

<!--For the complete dataset, there was no significant difference in observed species richness between the MHI and NWHI `r w_test(all_alpha$w_r_island)`, but Simpson diversity was significantly different ([@fig:fig_alpha[]{}A]; `r w_test(all_alpha$w_s_island,plain=TRUE)`). When only shallow arms \< 30 m were considered, neither comparison was significant (richness: `r w_test(shallow_alpha$w_r_island,plain=TRUE)`; Simpson: `r w_test(shallow_alpha$w_s_island,plain=TRUE)`).

When only shallow arms \< 30 m were considered, neither comparison was significant (richness: `r t_test(shallow_alpha$t_r_island,plain=TRUE)`; Simpson: `r t_test(shallow_alpha$t_s_island,plain=TRUE)`).

The drivers contributing most to explained variation were `r drivers$term[1]` (F = `r num(drivers$stat[1],0.01)`) and `r drivers$term[2]` (F = `r num(drivers$stat[2],0.01)`) ([@tbl:rda_table]).

<!-- 
Here's the thing: it's not that the differences between MHI & NWHI become non-significant with the inclusion of deep samples, 
it's just that the deep samples are MORE different from all the shallow samples than all the shallow samples are from one another?
We can think of PERMANOVA R^2 and ANOSIM R as effect sizes. Thus, it may be a bit weak but for shallow samples only, island group 
R2 = 0.072, for all samples R2 = 0.065. For depth (all samples of course), R2 = 0.110. If we consider the effect sizes from ANOSIM, 
for shallow samples, island group R = 0.175, for all samples, island group R = 0.161, and for shallow vs deep,  R = 0.509. 
The apparent difference in effect size is much more pronounced in the ANOSIM, but it's different in each case, and it's smaller
for all samples than it is for just shallow samples.
-->

Shallow crab community structure was significantly different between island groups (MHI vs. NWHI) (`r permanova(anova_region,0.01)`) as well as among individual islands (`r permanova(anova_island,0.01)`; see [@fig:fig_pairwise] for results of pairwise comparisons). There was no significant difference in community dispersion between the MHI and NWHI (`r permdisp(bd_region)`). When mesophotic ($\geq$ 30 m) ARMS units were included, there were significant differences among depth zones (\< 30 m, 30 m, 60 m, 90 m) (`r permanova(anova_depth,0.01)`) and community dispersion (`r permdisp(bd_depth)`). However, community dispersion was not different among depth zones $\geq$ 30 m (`r permdisp(bd_deep)`). Although crab communities varied significantly among both depth zones and island groups when examining the complete dataset (`r permanova(anova_both,0.01)`), depth explained `r num(effect_ratio,0.1)` times more variability than island group (based on model $\mathrm{R}^2$). In the CAP analysis, ARMS units were correctly assigned to sampling groups `r pc(cap_depth$percent/100,0.1)` of the time. The first two axes explained `r pc(cap_var$x,0.1)` and `r pc(cap_var$y,0.1)` of the variation, respectively. The $\geq$ 30 m samples from O&#x02BB;ahu grouped separately from the shallow samples collected across the entire ~2,500 km of the Hawaiian Islands ([@fig:fig_cap]). In addition, there was as much variability across the 30--90 m samples as across all shallow samples, with the 30 m samples spread out primarily along the LD2 (y) axis and the 60 m and 90 m samples forming a tight group ([@fig:fig_cap]).
